1. Define a list of numbers [10, 20, 30, 40, 50].
2. Print the length of the list.
3. Print the first element of the list.
4. Print the last element of the list.
5. Append a new number (e.g., 60) to the list.
6. Print the updated list.
7. Remove the second element from the list.
8. Print the list after removal.
9. Check if a specific number (e.g., 30) exists in the list and print the result.

```py
list_of_numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] #Define a list of numbers [10, 20, 30, 40, 50].
print('The list consists of', len(list_of_numbers), 'items') #Print the length of the list.
print ('First element of the list is:', list_of_numbers[0])#Print the first element of the list.
print ('Last element of the list is:', list_of_numbers[-1])#Print the last element of the list.
list_of_numbers.append(60) #Append a new number (e.g., 60) to the list.
print('After appending number 60, the List is following:', list_of_numbers) #Print the updated list
list_of_numbers.pop(1) #Remove the second element from the list.
print('After removing second element, the List is following:', list_of_numbers)#Print the list after removal.
#Check if a specific number (e.g., 30) exists in the list and print the result.
in_the_list = input('Check Is this in the list?:') #STRING 
try:
  in_the_list_int = int(in_the_list) #number

  if in_the_list or in_the_list_int in list_of_numbers:
